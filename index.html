                My name is Janet Bello.
                Learning about grit gives me a better understanding of my weaknesses and strengths. However, over time I realized I've been able to overcome a larger percentage. Such as nurturing my passion, being persistent in going out of my comfort zone to actualize what I'm passionate about.
                But a few ones left are emotional intelligence and imposter syndrome i.e. my feeling of not being capable or competent to take up a task, offer, or opportunity.
                Applying to Kodecamp 4.0 is to equip me with necessary skills to fight my fear, face my challenges, and overcome them.
                <p>
                My goals for this program are to gain a better understanding of ReactJS, its application to real-world projects, and to be prepared for internships and hackathons after graduation.
                It is important to achieve these goals because I want to win. I want to get a Tech Job, be the superstar tech sis, and be a solution provider to my community using technology.
                Obstacles that are likely to come are time constraints and power supply. Knowing quite well that combining work with training like this will be challenging as I may not be able to attend some classes.
                Anything worth doing well, is worth the sacrifice of doing extra. To overcome these obstacles, I've prepared myself to do a rewatch of videos at night, do my assignments or tasks at midnight to cover for my unavailability sometimes in the day.
                I have a mentor who encourages me to be at my best...
